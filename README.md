📌 Project Description

Hosted -> http://tsp-solver-lnd96o68h-poudhyalroshan-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/



The Traveling Salesman Problem asks:

"Given a list of cities and distances between each pair, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point."

This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) — a biologically-inspired optimization technique — to find near-optimal solutions for the TSP.

✨ Features
🏙️ Support for any number of cities

🔧 Fully customizable GA parameters:

Population size

Mutation rate

Number of generations

Selection & Crossover methods

📈 Real-time visualization of evolving tours (optional)

⚡ Fast and efficient solution even for larger datasets

🛠️ Easy to extend and modify
